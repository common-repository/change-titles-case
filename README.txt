The title transformation (converts) plugin adds administration functions to the management of posts, pages, categories and most custom content (ACF Compatible).

I created this plugin with the desire to help convert titles or transform titles case to various case styles on posts and categories.  Initially this was for handling issues due to importing improper cased data but I soon realized many people needed this.

The transform case plugin works by modifying the titles and provides certain advantages over CSS solutions by providing advanced control and customization.

Currently, the plugin supports Upper, Lower, and Mixed/Snake Case.  Sentence case is desired, but currently not supported due to the need for a list of nouns.  It should work with all latin languages, but is not currently language specific in its design.

This plugin allows you to set words/acronyms that will keep these key words lower or upper case.  This can allow you to change the case frequently.

Since this plugin runs from the Admin screen.  There is no requirement to keep this plugin after its transformation is performed, and it should not degrade the performance of your server.

No warranty is provided and we recommend backing up the system before performing any transformation.  Use at your own risk.

== Installation ==

To install, simply add it as you will any plugin.  The system will then add a new menu item under settings that can allow you to set the exceptions.

e.g.

1. Upload the zip file from wordpress to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or from the WordPress.org "Download" button or search for it and push the "Add Now" button.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Goto Settings->Change Titles Case to set the words to keep lower or upper when using Mixed case.
4. Goto any wordpress management page and you should see additions to the drop down for mass edits.
